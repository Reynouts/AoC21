# AoC21

##[--- Day 1: Sonar Sweep ---](http://adventofcode.com/2021/day/1)
We are back! Easy first day. Second part had something to do with
the sum of a sliding window and compare it with the next. The inner elements
are constant, so you only have to compare the one going out of the window, with
the one entering the window.

I challenged my first year students to make this puzzle too in Java.
They haven't got a lot of tools in their toolbox, but they managed to
solve it! Nice work.

##[--- Day 2: Dive! ---](http://adventofcode.com/2021/day/2)
Another easy one, with classic AoC instructions. This time involving a
submarine. Tried to make it generic making a dictionary mapping from 
instruction to function. Probably a lot harder to understand than the
easy solution with some duplicate code. Let's see if this submarine
manual will return in later puzzles!

##[--- Day 3: Binary Diagnostic ---](http://adventofcode.com/2021/day/3)
Needed to refresh some numpy knowledge for this one. Had to use my lunchbreak
to solve the second part, because I didn't have enough time in the morning
before work. Took it quite literally and squeezed in some recursion to shrink
the data matrix without any problems. I guess it was a straightforward puzzle,
without the need to optimize anything. 

But this is mostly the case in the first days and suddenly
the compelxity explodes! For now, I am really happy with the amount of time
I need to invest in the puzzles to solve them. There is enough room to improve
your code if you have the time, but it is not a necessity.
